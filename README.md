# food-app-project

Hello!

Here is a brief description of the "Food-app-project":

The purpose of this project is to create a website interface that will allow a user to order food. The main interface will have a header with an image, and below it there will be a small menu will a few items  (food). The user will be able to add the food from the home page to their cart.

The cart page will pop up as a modual. This modual will have some dynamic features for itself. From here, the user will be able to adjust the number of meals by ckicking  on the "plus" or "minus" buttons. As the user modifies the items in the cart, the total amount will be adjusted according to the order.
